With a dual mandate to accelerate researchers and enable frontier scale, we’re building a unified, modular runtime that meets researchers where they are and moves with them up the scaling curve.\n\nOur work focuses on three pillars: high-performance, asynchronous, zero-copy tensor and optimizer-state-aware data movement; performant, high-uptime, fault-tolerant training frameworks (training loop, state management, resilient checkpointing, deterministic orchestration, and observability); and distributed process management for long-lived, job-specific and user-provided processes.\n\nWe integrate proven large-scale capabilities into a composable, developer-facing runtime so teams can iterate quickly and run reliably at any scale, partnering closely with model-stack, research, and platform teams. Success for us is measured by raising both training throughput (how fast models train) and researcher throughput (how fast ideas become experiments and products).\n\nAbout the Role\n\nAs a Training: ML Framework Engineer, you will work on improving the training throughput for our internal training framework, while enabling researchers to experiment with new ideas.  This requires good engineering (for example designing, implementing, and optimizing state-of-the-art AI models), writing bug-free machine learning code (surprisingly difficult!), and acquiring deep knowledge of the performance of supercomputers. In all the projects this role pursues, the ultimate goal is to push the field forward.\n\nWe’re looking for people who love optimizing performance, understanding distributed systems, and who cannot stand having bugs in their code.  Since our training framework is used for large runs with massive numbers of GPUs, performance improvements here will have a large impact.\n\nThis role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Apply the latest techniques in our internal training framework to achieve impressive hardware efficiency for our training runs\n\n - Profile and optimize our training framework\n\n - Work with researchers to enable them to develop the next generation of models\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Have run small scale ML experiments\n\n - Love figuring out how systems work and continuously come up with ideas for how to make them faster while minimizing complexity and maintenance burden\n\n - Have strong software engineering skills and are proficient in Python\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates. For unincorporated Los Angeles County workers: we reasonably believe that criminal history may have a direct, adverse and negative relationship with the following job duties, potentially resulting in the withdrawal of a conditional offer of employment: protect computer hardware entrusted to you from theft, loss or damage; return all computer hardware in your possession (including the data contained therein) upon termination of employment or end of assignment; and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential, and non-public information. In addition, job duties require access to secure and protected information technology systems and related data security obligations.\n\nTo notify OpenAI that you believe this job posting is non-compliant, please submit a report through this form https://form.asana.com/?d=57018692298241&k=5MqR40fZd7jlxVUh5J-UeA.

You’ll work across systems, tooling, infrastructure, and product surfaces to make ambitious prototypes real, scalable, and robust.\n\nYou’ll have broad scope and meaningful influence: defining architecture, making build-vs-buy decisions, improving developer velocity, and helping take a project from early exploration to deployment and launch.\n\n\nYOU’LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR:\n\n - Building and owning core software components, from prototype through production.\n\n - Driving technical design, implementation, deployment, and launch of key systems and services.\n\n - Developing infrastructure and tooling that supports internal development workflows (e.g., data pipelines, evaluation, experiment tooling).\n\n - Integrating software across systems, ensuring reliability, performance, and observability.\n\n - Establishing pragmatic engineering standards (testing, CI/CD, release processes, operational playbooks) that enable rapid iteration without sacrificing quality.\n\n - Troubleshooting complex end-to-end issues across system boundaries and improving system debuggability.\n\n - Collaborating closely with cross-functional partners, communicating tradeoffs, and unblocking progress with a bias toward action.\n\n\nWE’RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH:\n\n - Extreme agency: you identify the highest-leverage problems and move them forward with minimal direction.\n\n - Creativity and a founder mentality: you enjoy turning ambiguity into a concrete plan and shipping outcomes.\n\n - Strong technical foundation and can make good architectural decisions under real constraints.\n\n - A high bar for quality and details, especially around reliability, maintainability, and user/developer experience.\n\n - Strong prioritization: you know when to go deep, when to simplify, and when to ship.\n\n - Strong software engineering experience building and shipping production systems.\n\n - Proficiency in at least one systems/product language (e.g., Python, C++, Rust, Go) and comfort learning new stacks.\n\n - Experience designing APIs/services and working with distributed systems, performance, or reliability concerns.\n\n - Track record of owning projects end-to-end: design → implementation → deployment → operations.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates. For unincorporated Los Angeles County workers: we reasonably believe that criminal history may have a direct, adverse and negative relationship with the following job duties, potentially resulting in the withdrawal of a conditional offer of employment: protect computer hardware entrusted to you from theft, loss or damage; return all computer hardware in your possession (including the data contained therein) upon termination of employment or end of assignment; and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential, and non-public information. In addition, job duties require access to secure and protected information technology systems and related data security obligations.\n\nTo notify OpenAI that you believe this job posting is non-compliant, please submit a report through this form https://form.asana.com/?d=57018692298241&k=5MqR40fZd7jlxVUh5J-UeA.

Our team is a fast-moving group within OpenAI, bringing together research, engineering, design, and product. We iteratively build the Codex agent harness and product to get the most out of the model, and we iteratively train the model to be great at complex software engineering tasks.\n\nThe Codex team is responsible for building state-of-the-art AI systems that can write code, reason about software, and act as intelligent agents for developers and non-developers alike. We operate across research, engineering, product, and infrastructure; owning the full lifecycle of experimentation, deployment, and iteration on novel coding capabilities.\n\nCodex for Teams builds products and platform capabilities to drive the adoption of Codex in diverse team environments. It is a cross-cutting team that works across the stack to build both delightful product experiences and fundamental platform capabilities. Its customers range from small teams to large enterprises, and our mission is critical to achieving the vision of Codex as a proactive teammate.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nThis role is for a software engineer working on Codex, with a specific focus on enabling team-scale adoption across a wide spectrum of environments, from internal teams at OpenAI to external customers ranging from startups to large enterprises. You’ll work directly with customers, Go To Market (GTM) teams, and other engineers and researchers across Codex and OpenAI. You will turn diverse team requirements into products that scale across organizations. The role bridges what teams with Codex’s capabilities, ensuring that they are robust, repeatable, and deeply aligned with how developers work in real-world environments. You’ll own systems end-to-end (architecture, implementation, production operations) with a strong bias for both quality and velocity.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Ship fundamental capabilities including analytics dashboards and APIs, compliance and audit surfaces, workspace RBAC and admin controls, managed configuration and constraints, and rate limits, usage, and pricing primitives for teams.\n\n - Design and build robust, full-stack services and APIs that power Codex across surfaces (web/app, CLI/local, IDEs, CI/CD) with strong observability, reliability, and security.\n\n - Enable standardized team deployments by building team configuration packaging and distribution patterns that make it easy to roll out consistent experiences across workspaces.\n\n - Integrate with enterprise identity and governance systems (e.g., SSO/SAML/OIDC, SCIM, RBAC, policy enforcement), and build data-access patterns that are secure, performant, and compliant for large customers.\n\n - Partner with GTM to work hands-on with teams through deep engagements to accelerate adoption, iterate rapidly, and translate real-world feedback into scalable product and platform improvements.\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Have strong software engineering fundamentals and experience turning ideas into productionized systems, thinking holistically about speed, performance, and user experience.\n\n - Are proficient in one or more backend languages (e.g., Python, Go, Rust) and distributed systems concepts, with a focus on reliability, observability, and security.\n\n - Enjoy building cross-cutting platform capabilities that unlock product velocity, and you’re comfortable working across services, APIs, and end-user product surfaces.\n\n - Have experience with team/enterprise foundations such as identity and access (SAML/OIDC), SCIM, RBAC, audit/compliance logging, policy enforcement, and data governance controls.\n\n - Have built developer tools and workflows (CLI/IDE/SDK), automation systems (triggers/scheduling), or integration platforms that connect products to a broader ecosystem of tools.\n\n - Like working directly with users/customers (or alongside GTM/solutions teams), and can translate messy, diverse requirements into opinionated implementations that scale across many teams.\n\n - Enjoy 0 -> 1 environments, can navigate ambiguity, and bring crisp product thinking to technical trade-offs.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products.

      "content_plain": "About the Team\n\nThe Frontier Systems team at OpenAI builds, launches, and supports the largest supercomputers in the world that OpenAI uses for its most cutting edge model training.\n\nWe take data center designs, turn them into real, working systems and build any software needed for running large-scale frontier model trainings.\n\nOur mission is to bring up, stabilize and keep these hyperscale supercomputers reliable and efficient during the training of the frontier models.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nWe are looking for engineers to operate the next generation of compute clusters that power OpenAI’s frontier research.\n\nThis role blends distributed systems engineering with hands-on infrastructure work on our largest datacenters. You will scale Kubernetes clusters to massive scale, automate bare-metal bring-up, and build the software layer that hides the complexity of a magnitude of nodes across multiple data centers.\n\nYou will work at the intersection of hardware and software, where speed and reliability are critical. Expect to manage fast-moving operations, quickly diagnose and fix issues when things are on fire, and continuously raise the bar for automation and uptime.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Spin up and scale large Kubernetes clusters, including automation for provisioning, bootstrapping, and cluster lifecycle management\n\n - Build software abstractions that unify multiple clusters and present a seamless interface to training workloads\n\n - Own node bring-up from bare metal through firmware upgrades, ensuring fast, repeatable deployment at massive scale\n\n - Improve operational metrics such as reducing cluster restart times (e.g., from hours to minutes) and accelerating firmware or OS upgrade cycles\n\n - Integrate networking and hardware health systems to deliver end-to-end reliability across servers, switches, and data center infrastructure\n\n - Develop monitoring and observability systems to detect issues early and keep clusters stable under extreme load\n\n - Be expected to execute at the same level as a software engineer\n\nYou might thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Have deep experience operating or scaling Kubernetes clusters or similar container orchestration systems in high-growth or hyperscale environments\n\n - Bring strong programming or scripting skills (Python, Go, or similar) and familiarity with Infrastructure-as-Code tools such as Terraform or CloudFormation\n\n - Are comfortable with bare-metal Linux environments, GPU hardware, and large-scale networking\n\n - Enjoy solving fast-moving, high-impact operational problems and building automation to eliminate manual work\n\n - Can balance careful engineering with the urgency of keeping mission-critical systems running\n\nQualifications\n\n - Experience as an infrastructure, systems, or distributed systems engineer in large-scale or high-availability environments\n\n - Strong knowledge of Kubernetes internals, cluster scaling patterns, and containerized workloads\n\n - Proficiency in cloud infrastructure concepts (compute, networking, storage, security) and in automating cluster or data center operations\n\nBonus: background with GPU workloads, firmware management, or high-performance computing\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.

You’ll work across the stack - from low-level kernel performance to high-level distributed execution - and collaborate closely with research, infra, and performance teams to ensure our largest models run smoothly on new hardware.\n\nThis is a high-impact opportunity to shape OpenAI’s multi-platform inference capabilities from the ground up with a particular focus on advancing inference performance on AMD accelerators.\n\nIn this role, you will:\n\n - Own bring-up, correctness and performance of the OpenAI inference stack on AMD hardware.\n\n - Integrate internal model-serving infrastructure (e.g., vLLM, Triton) into a variety of GPU-backed systems.\n\n - Debug and optimize distributed inference workloads across memory, network, and compute layers.\n\n - Validate correctness, performance, and scalability of model execution on large GPU clusters.\n\n - Collaborate with partner teams to design and optimize high-performance GPU kernels for accelerators using HIP, Triton, or other performance-focused frameworks.\n\n - Collaborate with partner teams to build, integrate and tune collective communication libraries (e.g., RCCL) used to parallelize model execution across many GPUs.\n\nYou can thrive in this role if you:\n\n - Have experience writing or porting GPU kernels using HIP, CUDA, or Triton, and care deeply about low-level performance.\n\n - Are familiar with communication libraries like NCCL/RCCL and understand their role in high-throughput model serving.\n\n - Have worked on distributed inference systems and are comfortable scaling models across fleets of accelerators.\n\n - Enjoy solving end-to-end performance challenges across hardware, system libraries, and orchestration layers.\n\n - Are excited to be part of a small, fast-moving team building new infrastructure from first principles.\n\nNice to Have:\n\n - Contributions to open-source libraries like RCCL, Triton, or vLLM.\n\n - Experience with GPU performance tools (Nsight, rocprof, perf) and memory/comms profiling.\n\n - Prior experience deploying inference on other non-NVIDIA GPU environments.\n\n - Knowledge of model/tensor parallelism, mixed precision, and serving 10B+ parameter models.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates. For unincorporated Los Angeles County workers: we reasonably believe that criminal history may have a direct, adverse and negative relationship with the following job duties, potentially resulting in the withdrawal of a conditional offer of employment: protect computer hardware entrusted to you from theft, loss or damage; return all computer hardware in your possession (including the data contained therein) upon termination of employment or end of assignment; and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary, confidential, and non-public information. In addition, job duties require access to secure and protected information technology systems and related data security obligations.\n\nTo notify OpenAI that you believe this job posting is non-compliant, please submit a report through this form https://form.asana.com/?d=57018692298241&k=5MqR40fZd7jlxVUh5J-UeA.

      "content_plain": "ABOUT THE TEAM\n\nThe Account & Platform Integrity team protects OpenAI’s ecosystem from fraud, impersonation, abuse, and account-level threats. We ensure that the people and organizations using OpenAI are who they claim to be, that access is used appropriately, and that bad actors are prevented from exploiting the platform.\n\nWe operate at the intersection of identity, access, compliance, and abuse prevention, working closely with Product, Engineering, Legal, Go-To-Market, and Support teams to stop harmful activity before it impacts users, customers, or the business. Our work directly protects revenue, user trust, and platform safety across ChatGPT, the API, and enterprise products.\n\n\nABOUT THE ROLE\n\nWe’re hiring a Fraud & Risk Analyst to help safeguard OpenAI by investigating, validating, and monitoring customer accounts and organizations. You will focus on identity, legitimacy, and risk, ensuring accounts are properly verified, access is appropriate, and emerging threats are detected early.\n\nYou’ll handle sensitive and high-stakes investigations involving fraud, impersonation, sanctions, misuse of access, and coordinated abuse. Your work will directly influence who can use OpenAI’s products and how safely we can scale.\n\nNote: This role may involve reviewing sensitive, confidential, or disturbing content.\n\nWe use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week in our San Francisco office.\n\n\nIN THIS ROLE YOU WILL:\n\n - Review and verify customer identities, organizations, and ownership structures\n\n - Investigate suspicious or high-risk accounts (e.g., fraud, impersonation, shell companies, abuse of API or ChatGPT access)\n\n - Evaluate documents, internal data, and third-party sources to determine legitimacy and risk\n\n - Enforce account-level actions such as approvals, restrictions, suspensions, or escalations\n\n - Serve as the case owner for complex, high-visibility verification and integrity cases\n\n - Partner with Legal, Compliance, Sales, and Support to resolve issues quickly and accurately\n\n - Handle escalations, appeals, and sensitive customer communications\n\n - Help design and improve verification workflows, fraud detection, and risk-scoring systems\n\n - Contribute to automation, tooling, and human-in-the-loop review pipelines\n\n - Identify patterns of abuse and recommend new controls or safeguards\n\n - Analyze data to uncover fraud and abuse trends\n\n - Provide feedback to Product and Engineering to improve onboarding, verification, and access controls\n\n - Create clear playbooks and guidance for frontline teams handling high-risk accounts\n   \n\n\nYOU MIGHT THRIVE IN THIS ROLE IF YOU...\n\n - Have 5+ years of experience in verifications, fraud, trust & safety, or risk investigations\n\n - Are comfortable making high-impact decisions about who should — or should not — have platform access\n\n - Have experience working cross-functionally with Legal, Product, Sales, and Operations\n\n - Enjoy building systems, not just running them — especially in fast-moving environments\n\n - Are calm under pressure, detail-oriented, and trusted with sensitive and ambiguous cases\n\n - Thrive in environments that require judgment, speed, and accountability\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity. \n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.\n\nFor additional information, please see OpenAI’s Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement https://cdn.openai.com/policies/eeo-policy-statement.pdf.\n\nBackground checks for applicants will be administered in accordance with applicable law, and qualified applicants with arrest or conviction records will be considered for employment consistent with those laws, including the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, the Los Angeles County Fair Chance Ordinance for Employers, and the California Fair Chance Act, for US-based candidates.

      "content_plain": "About OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is on a mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. Startups across EMEA are at the forefront of this mission—building, experimenting, and scaling new products powered by OpenAI’s platform.\n\nAcross the region, founders and builders are using OpenAI to create entirely new categories, reimagine existing industries, and bring AI-powered products to market faster than ever before. Supporting this ecosystem—credibly, responsibly, and at scale—is a core priority for OpenAI.\n\nAbout the Team\n\nLike every team at OpenAI, the Marketing team contributes directly to our mission of responsible and widespread AI adoption.\n\nThe Startups Marketing function focuses on founders, builders, and early-stage companies—helping them discover, adopt, and scale on OpenAI’s platform. We do this through a combination of field programs, events, content, community initiatives, and ecosystem partnerships.\n\nIn EMEA, this work is tightly integrated with regional GTM efforts and delivered in close partnership with Sales, Partnerships, Developer Experience, Product, and Comms teams, while remaining aligned with global startup strategy and messaging.\n\nAbout the Role\n\nThis role sits at the intersection of startup GTM, field marketing, community, and ecosystem engagement across EMEA.\n\nReporting to EMEA B2B Marketing leadership, with alignment to the global Startups Marketing team, you will own the regional execution of OpenAI’s startup field marketing strategy—translating global priorities into high-impact, locally relevant programs that drive startup adoption, pipeline support, and long-term ecosystem strength.\n\nThis is a role for someone who can move fluidly between strategy and execution—setting direction, building plans, and then rolling up their sleeves to deliver. You will be expected to context-switch effectively between long-term thinking and hands-on execution in a fast-moving, evolving environment.\n\nYou will work closely with regional Startup and GTM teams to support pipeline generation and deal acceleration, while also building durable relationships with founders, investors, accelerators, and ecosystem partners. From major third-party moments (such as Slush, Bits & Pretzels, and Web Summit) to owned events, hackathons, and community programs, you will ensure OpenAI shows up credibly, consistently, and with impact across the EMEA startup landscape.\n\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nStartup GTM & Field Execution\n\n - Own and execute the EMEA startup field marketing strategy in close partnership with regional Startup and GTM teams.\n\n - Translate GTM priorities into programs that drive adoption and measurable business outcomes\n\n - Balance strategic planning with hands-on execution, context-switching effectively as priorities evolve.\n\n - Act as a key partner to the regional startup team.\n\nPrograms, Events & Scalable Platforms\n\n - Build and evolve OpenAI’s external startup programs as core engagement channels, owning the value proposition and end-to-end founder experience.\n\n - Plan and execute high-impact startup and investor-focused events across EMEA, including owned events and priority third-party ecosystem moments.\n\n - Design scalable, repeatable program formats and playbooks that can be reused across markets\n\n - Ensure programs and activations deliver clear business and ecosystem outcomes, not just visibility.\n\nCommunity, Ecosystem & Distribution\n\n - Build and maintain strong relationships with founders, VCs, accelerators, incubators, and ecosystem organisations across EMEA.\n\n - Partner with ecosystem leaders to build early relationships with high-potential founders.\n\n - Identify and launch new distribution channels to reach builders with differentiated, useful content beyond traditional marketing surfaces.\n\n - Surface ecosystem insights and opportunities back to internal teams.\n\nCo-Marketing, Social & Amplification\n\n - Collaborate with ecosystem and technology partners on co-marketing initiatives, joint events, and shared programs.\n\n - Work with Comms to amplify OpenAI’s startup presence and success stories through media, events, and ecosystem moments.\n\n - Partner with startups, founders, and customer marketing to co-create and scale social content that drives authentic, peer-to-peer reach.\n\nContent, Narrative & Product Translation\n\n - Develop and localise startup-focused content, including case studies, guides, playbooks, and ecosystem resources.\n\n - Translate API and platform launches into startup-relevant narratives and practical guidance with Product and Solutions teams.\n\n - Build systems and processes that allow startup marketing output to scale without sacrificing quality.\n\nInsights & AI-Native Ways of Working\n\n - Gather insights from founders and partners and turn them into actionable feedback for Product, GTM, Sales, and Partnerships teams.\n\n - Use OpenAI’s tools and AI-enabled workflows to scale your own impact and amplify output across planning, execution, and reporting.\n\n - Act as a role model for AI-powered marketing execution within the EMEA team.\n\nWho You Are\n\n - 5–7+ years of experience in startup marketing, field marketing, ecosystem marketing, or community-led roles, ideally in tech or high-growth environments.\n\n - Equally comfortable setting strategy and executing hands-on, with the ability to context-switch effectively between the two.\n\n - Strong systems thinker with experience building scalable programs, frameworks, or platforms that can be reused across markets.\n\n - Deep familiarity with the EMEA startup ecosystem, including founders, investors, accelerators, and key industry events.\n\n - Proven experience owning and executing field programs tied to GTM goals, pipeline support, or deal acceleration.\n\n - AI- and tech-savvy, with a track record of using modern tools to scale output and impact.\n\n - Strong storyteller with experience creating and localising content across multiple formats.\n\n - Comfortable operating cross-functionally with GTM, Product, Partnerships, Developer Experience, and Comms teams.\n\n - Highly organised, proactive, and effective in fast-moving, evolving environments.\n\n - Experience working with global teams and deploying centrally owned programs\n\n - Based in EU (London preferred), with willingness to travel regionally for events as needed.\n\n - Additional language skills (French or German) a bonus\n\nWhy Join OpenAI\n\nThis role offers a unique opportunity to shape how startups across EMEA engage with OpenAI at a pivotal moment for AI adoption.\n\nYou will work directly with founders, investors, and ecosystem leaders, influence real GTM outcomes, and help position OpenAI as a trusted, long-term partner to the startup community across the region.\n\nAbout OpenAI\n\nOpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity.
