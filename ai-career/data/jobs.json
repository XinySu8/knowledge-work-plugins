You will own strategy and execution with top ISVs across cybersecurity (identity, endpoint, governance, compliance, data protection, threat detection) and observability (logging, monitoring, APM, telemetry) — building integrations, co-creating joint GTM plays, and helping our field and customers realize the value of combining Databricks with leading security and observability partners.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who has “seen the movie” on what works and what doesn’t at one or more hyperscalers and, ideally, has also worked at a leading cybersecurity or observability ISV. The role demands both technical and GTM acumen — able to work with Product and Engineering teams on integrations across identity, governance, logging, and monitoring, as well as with Sales and Marketing teams on go-to-market execution. It is a fast-paced, cross-functional role requiring strong communication, prioritization, and presentation skills, and the ability to quickly context-switch between product, engineering, and field conversations. Success will require deep subject matter expertise in large-scale technology ecosystems, coupled with a scrappy, entrepreneurial spirit to build high-quality programs that establish Databricks as the best place to run security and observability workloads for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;2006&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-renderer-mark=&quot;true&quot;&gt;The impact you will have:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Define and execute Databricks’ security and observability ISV partnership strategy, including segmentation, prioritization, and success metrics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own executive and working-level relationships with top security and observability ISVs to drive integrations and joint field execution.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Product and Security/Trust teams to design, validate, and launch integrations that enhance governance, compliance, security, and observability for Databricks customers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Build joint value propositions and scalable GTM motions with ISVs that resonate with CISOs, compliance officers, observability leaders, and data practitioners.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Partner with Sales leadership to design and land co-sell plays, enablement, and incentives that bring joint solutions to market.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Drive co-marketing initiatives and category-level campaigns with Marketing to generate joint demand.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Represent Databricks externally with partners, customers, and industry forums.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Advocate internally for partner and customer needs, influencing product roadmap and GTM strategy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;2367&quot;&gt;&lt;strong data-renderer-mark=&quot;true&quot;&gt;What we look for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;10+ years in product partnerships, business development, or partner management, including 7+ years focused on security, observability, or cloud ecosystems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proven success launching ISV integrations and GTM motions in security and/or observability with hyperscalers, with a track record of delivering measurable partner-sourced or partner-influenced revenue.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deep understanding and network across cybersecurity and observability ecosystems — identity, governance, compliance, threat detection, data protection, logging, monitoring, and APM, and ability to develop joint value propositions that resonate with technical and business decision-makers alike.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Strong cross-functional leadership skills — able to influence Product, Engineering, Sales, Marketing, and Security/Trust teams.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Experience navigating co-opetition dynamics and sensitive partner relationships.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Excellent written, verbal, and presentation skills — able to build crisp narratives for executive and C-level audiences.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Grit, humility, and the ability to operate in a high-growth, founder-led environment.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field; or equivalent practical experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p data-renderer-start-pos=&quot;2367&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;content-pay-transparency&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;pay-input&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pay Range Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px;&quot;&gt;Databricks is committed to fair and equitable compensation practices.

You will own strategy and execution with top ISVs across cybersecurity (identity, endpoint, governance, compliance, data protection, threat detection) and observability (logging, monitoring, APM, telemetry) — building integrations, co-creating joint GTM plays, and helping our field and customers realize the value of combining Databricks with leading security and observability partners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are looking for someone who has “seen the movie” on what works and what doesn’t at one or more hyperscalers and, ideally, has also worked at a leading cybersecurity or observability ISV. The role demands both technical and GTM acumen — able to work with Product and Engineering teams on integrations across identity, governance, logging, and monitoring, as well as with Sales and Marketing teams on go-to-market execution. It is a fast-paced, cross-functional role requiring strong communication, prioritization, and presentation skills, and the ability to quickly context-switch between product, engineering, and field conversations.
