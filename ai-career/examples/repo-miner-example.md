---

### 3. Core components
- Data loading module  
- Model definition  
- Training loop  
- Evaluation logic  
- Configuration handling  

---

### 4. Setup checklist
1. Clone repository  
2. Install dependencies  
3. Run training script  
4. Verify output metrics  

---

### 5. 7-Day Plan

Day 1: Clone repo and run training once successfully.  
Day 2: Read model architecture and summarize it in notes.  
Day 3: Modify one hyperparameter and observe change.  
Day 4: Add logging for metrics.  
Day 5: Write experiment summary.  
Day 6: Refactor small function for clarity.  
Day 7: Create short demo README and push changes.
