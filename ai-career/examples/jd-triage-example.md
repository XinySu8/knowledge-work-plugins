# JD Triage Example

## Input JD (excerpt)
Machine Learning Engineer
Requirements:
- Experience with PyTorch
- Experience with distributed training
- Strong Python skills
- Familiarity with large language models
- Experience with evaluation metrics

## Output (following jd-triage-5min format)

1. Role type
Machine Learning Engineer (Applied / Model Training)

2. Must-haves
- PyTorch experience
- Distributed training
- Strong Python
- LLM familiarity
- Evaluation metrics

3. Match rating
Yellow — Python and PyTorch present, but no distributed training experience.

4. New-to-me skills list
- Distributed training
- Model parallelism
- Multi-GPU training

5. Resume tweak
Original: Built ML models using PyTorch.
Rewritten: Implemented and evaluated machine learning models using PyTorch with structured experimentation and metric tracking.

6. Final decision
Maybe — strong core alignment, but missing distributed training exposure.

7. If Apply/Maybe
Run deep mode with resume bullets.
