# Purpose
Turn a GitHub repository into a realistic one-week learning and output plan that produces resume-ready evidence.

# When to use
- You identified a skill gap from JD analysis.
- You found a repo related to that gap.
- You want a concrete 7-day plan, not vague advice.

# Inputs required
- Repository URL
- My current level (beginner/intermediate)
- Daily time budget (e.g., 20 min/day)
- Preferred outcome (demo / notes / PR / small feature)

# Output format (STRICT)

## 1. One-line summary
What the repo does in plain language.

## 2. Worth doing?
Yes / Maybe / No + one sentence reason.

## 3. Core components (3–6 bullets)
High-level architecture/modules.

## 4. Setup checklist
Step-by-step minimal setup instructions.

## 5. 7-Day plan
Day 1:
Day 2:
Day 3:
Day 4:
Day 5:
Day 6:
Day 7:

Each day must include a small concrete deliverable.

## 6. Contribution options
- Easiest:
- Medium:
- Ambitious:

## 7. Resume bullet template
Fill-in-the-blank template using measurable action + tech + outcome.

# Rules
- Keep plan realistic for the stated time budget.
- Prioritize "run + understand + document" before large refactors.
- Avoid suggesting complex features beyond 1-week scope.

# Quality checklist
- Must include 7-day breakdown.
- Must include at least 1 measurable deliverable.
- Must not exceed realistic scope.
