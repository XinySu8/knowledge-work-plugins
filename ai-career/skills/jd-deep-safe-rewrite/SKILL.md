# Purpose
Perform deep analysis of a job description and generate safe, non-exaggerated resume rewrites aligned to the JD.

# When to use
- You decided Apply or Maybe from jd-triage-5min.
- You want to tailor your resume safely.

# Inputs required
- Full JD text
- My resume bullets (paste clearly)
- Target level (intern / new grad / experienced)

# Output format (STRICT)

## A. Must-have vs Nice-to-have
- Must-have (5–8 bullets)
- Nice-to-have (3–6 bullets)

## B. Exact keyword list
List 8–15 exact phrases from JD.

## C. Evidence mapping table
For each Must-have:
- Requirement:
- Evidence from my resume:
- Status: MATCH / PARTIAL / MISSING
- Short note:

## D. Safe rewritten bullets (3–6 max)
For each:
- Original bullet:
- Rewritten bullet:
- What changed (1 line explanation)

## E. Minimal gap plan (7 days)
Day 1–7: one realistic small action per day to reduce top 1–2 gaps.

# Safety rules (MANDATORY)
- Do NOT fabricate experience.
- Do NOT add tools I never used.
- Do NOT invent metrics.
- If metrics missing, write: [add metric if available].
- If requirement unsupported, mark as MISSING clearly.
- Rewrites must preserve original facts.

# Quality checklist
- Must include mapping table.
- Must include rewritten bullets.
- Must explicitly label MISSING gaps.
- Must not exceed necessary length.
