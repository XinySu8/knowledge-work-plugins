# Purpose
Quickly evaluate a job description (JD) within 5 minutes to decide whether to apply, record unfamiliar skills, and suggest minimal resume tweaks.

# When to use
- You want a fast screening of a JD.
- You do NOT want a long analysis.
- You only want a high-level decision + gap recording.

# Inputs required
- Full JD text (paste)
- My resume bullets (optional but recommended)
- Target role type (optional)

# Output format (STRICT)
1. Role type (one line)
2. Top 3–5 Must-have requirements
3. Match rating: Green / Yellow / Red + 1 sentence explanation
4. New-to-me skills list (3–8 items, only names)
5. Resume tweak (1–2 safe rewritten bullets, NO exaggeration)
6. Final decision: Apply / Maybe / Skip + 1 sentence reason
7. If Apply/Maybe → say: "Run deep mode with resume bullets."

# Non-negotiable rules
- Do NOT fabricate experience.
- Do NOT invent metrics.
- If evidence is missing, write "UNKNOWN".
- Keep output concise.
- Prioritize Requirements / Qualifications section of JD.

# Quality checklist
- Must-haves limited to 3–5.
- Must include New-to-me skills.
- Must include Resume tweak.
- Must give a clear Apply/Maybe/Skip.
